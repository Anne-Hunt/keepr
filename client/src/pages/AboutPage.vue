    <h1>About Keepr</h1>
     <p>Keepr is a social network for users to share and save links to other content. They can create Vaults, named however they choose, to fill with Keeps, the links they save. They can also keep the Keeps others have shared in their own personal vaults. Users can also see each other's profiles and choose to keep some, if not all, of their vaults private. It features a mobile responsive masonry layout with pages for the home, about, individual profiles, vaults, and the authenticated user's accounts. Users are able to create, edit, and delete their own content, as well as determine what others can see.</p>
